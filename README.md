#CAP1166 Output Sink#

Sinks a pin as an open collector with a CAP1166 touch controller - used for upgrading a Lenovo Pro2840m display with a 4K HDR TV board which has a ladder ADC for the pushbuttons; this display was not ready for the future of 4K streaming since it does not support HDMI 2.0 (and HDCP 2.2 required for protected 4K content) on any of its inputs despite being a 2014 model introduced after HDMI 2.0 was released in September 2013.

Requires PinsToBus library (version 1.1.0 or later which has required open collector operation): http://github.com/brycecherry75/PinsToBus
